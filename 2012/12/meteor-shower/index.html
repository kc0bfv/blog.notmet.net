        <p>The back of a truck is an appropriate place to watch a meteor shower.  I had driven out onto a back road in Yellow Springs, Ohio, to watch the meteors fall, and I was not disappointed.  Orion knew where most of them were coming from - he was calling the shots.</p>
<p>I had barely pulled off the two-lane dirt road and onto some tire tracks in the grass.  A run-down barbed wire fence with old knotty posts ran alongside the road, and was only a few feet from the truck.  Fortunately, some farmer had left room for me.</p>
<p>In this part of the US the sky is never truly dark.  Even on this cloudless night I could see Xenia&rsquo;s light, about 10 miles away, low and dim on the horizon.  The light from Cincinnati, another 30 mi past Xenia, was clearly visible in the South.</p>
<p>Radio towers blinked on the horizon.  I could count perhaps 20, warning the aircraft flying overhead.  And there were 10 or more aircraft overhead at any given time.  It&rsquo;s easy to count aircraft with such a big sky.  The open fields surrounding me had few trees, and then only at a distance.</p>
<p>A car passed my truck as I lay in the bed.  I saw it approach through the cab windows, and at the same time the grass over my shoulder rustled.  I covered my eyes to try to maintain my night vision.  A house cat or something was moving through the grass, a short distance from the fence.</p>
<p>The car&rsquo;s headlight was blinding now, as it finally passed me.  The shush of its tires on the dirt was deafening in the country-night silence.</p>
<p>A trick of the headlights caught the corner of my eye, and I noticed a misshapen old fencepost not far from the truck.  It had been placed only a few feet away from the neighboring posts.  Perhaps the farmer had replaced it, but decided not to dig it out.</p>
<p>The meteor shower picked up intensity overhead.  They fell almost two every ten seconds.  One large meteor burned out quickly, and only covered a small portion of the sky.  Another broke into two, burning across the sky together.  A third meteor was dim enough to nearly miss, but left a streak across half the sky.  It must have only skimmed the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Again, the fencepost caught the corner of my eye.  It seemed to change shape slightly.  The rest of my eye was drawn to it, and I craned my head to look properly.</p>
<p>Clearly now I watched as the fencepost moved, taking the shape of a head atop shoulders.  A figure turned and moved towards me from where the fencepost had been standing.</p>
<p>I recoiled in shock, and slammed my head on the edge of the truck bed.  Trying to scramble to my feet, I found that my leg had fallen asleep, and was useless.  As I leaned on the side wall to stand, I tumbled over and into the dirt near the driver&rsquo;s side door.</p>
<p>The figure had closed on me, and was reaching out to me, as I lay in the dirt.  I couldn&rsquo;t find the keys in my pocket, somehow it was filled only with old receipts and gum wrappers.  I pushed myself into a sitting position, and kicked back, slamming into the tire well.</p>
<p>The being was upon me now.  He grabbed my arm - I couldn&rsquo;t move.  There was no room even for horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you give me a ride?&rdquo;</p>
