14lbs pork butt at $1.89 per pound from Costco.  5.9 lbs salmon from Costco at $6.99 per pound.

2025: started the smoker, with apple chips this time, at 225℉.

2050: salted and Memphis dusted the pork, 1.5 cups dust, .5 tsp salt per pound (2 1/3 Tbsp).

2110: it's on the smoker!  Marked probe on bottom.

2130: salmon is brining in the fridge.

0830: 165℉ and 172℉, raising the smoker to 275℉.

1200: 192℉ and 205℉, starting the fish drying.

1345: bottom probe says 199℉, and that's the one I'm trusting.  I think the top one is in too shallow.

1430: 201℉ - close enough!

1500: fish is on!

{{<fig-res res="pork_20th_1530.jpg" alt="Pork, all pulled and ready to eat or store" caption="This tasted fantastic, but most of it still goes in the freezer">}}

1900: fish all done, a little over temp at 152℉.

{{<fig-res res="salmon_20th_1910.jpg" alt="Completed, smoked salmon, still a pink color similar to before it went on, but slightly darker and with some browned edges.  More shiny than previously, due to the maple syrup I mop on." caption="So pretty, so tasty.">}}

I couldn't notice any difference due to the apple wood.  Maybe I'm just an unsophisticated bum.
