Alright, time for more beef jerky.  This time I found top round roast for $3.99 per pound.  I'm using the same recipe as last time, but it's 3.5 lbs so I multiplied the marinade by about 1.5.  I sliced the meat more along the grain than last time, and also slightly thicker.







1530: Meat is in the marinade.







1020 Sunday: Meat is on the smoker, 175℉, vents half open this time cause why not, that's what I normally do.







1430: I took all but the fatty pieces of jerky off, leaving those on with temperature increased to 225℉.  They were glistening still, and I'd like them to dry out more before taking them off.  I'm skeptical about the slightly thicker cuts.  They're definitely done, but will they stay good to eat as long as the thinner stuff did...  Did they get dessicated enough to last?  Some of the chunks are very much like smoked beef...  We'll see as time passes and I start to eat it...  I'm thinking I'll leave the fatty stuff for another hour.







1540: looks done enough...  Taking off the last of it.







Fatty parts got much drier, but still not like the other pieces.  I think next time I should start by cutting off all fat.  This time I would've had to start by slicing the meat along the thin internal fat layer it had, then peeling of that fat.  It would've left one thin layer of meat and one thick, but that would've been ok.
