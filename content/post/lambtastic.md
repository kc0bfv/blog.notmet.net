This is lamb weekend.  Some folks call it Easter weekend.  I'm doing two legs of lamb - right leg and left leg.  Both are about 4.7 lbs, $5.99 per pound.  Today, Saturday, I'm going to smoke one based on [this recipe](https://www.theblackpeppercorn.com/2017/05/smoked-leg-of-lamb-boneless/), and tomorrow I'm going to Sous Vide one based on the same recipe I've used in the past.  Sarah likes meat more well-done than I do, and with lamb I don't mind that much, so my target is medium-well.







1520 Saturday: late start on marinading the lamb for the smoker.







1600: putting the lamb on at 250℉, aiming for internal temperature of 160-165℉.







1700: internal temperature is 76℉.







1800: internal temperature is 126℉.  I'd really like to eat around 1900, so I'm going to crank the temperature up to 275℉ to keep this party going.







1900: temperature is at 157℉, we're gonna make it!







1930: took the lamb off the smoker, it was at 167℉.







The result was great, the lamb was nice and smoky.  It was well done, and Sarah thought that was perfect.  Not the best lamb I've had, I thought the crust was not quite the perfect complement to the lamb and the smoke, but I'd still definitely make this again, I liked it a lot.







With the sous vide one, I used the [same recipe as previously](https://blog.notmet.net/2018/02/sous-vide-lamb-leg/), but forgot to not add extra salt with the olives. Oh well.







1330 Sunday: meat is prepped and immersed, sous vide set to 165℉ to get a doneness that Sarah likes, like the smoked meat.  I've set it for 10 hours, but it won't take that long.  We plan to go for a motorcycle ride and then come back.  It should be done any time between 3 and 6 hours from now.







1900: took out the lamb and dropped it in a hot cast iron skillet for a few minutes, rotating it regularly.  Quite a bit of water got into the bag, so I had to reduce the sauce for a good 20 minutes.  No problem.







I actually liked the sous vide version a little better, Sarah preferred the smoked.  I think she got a cool rubbery piece of lamb by the time she tasted the sous vide version.  I warned her to heat it up, but no dice.  I thought the smoked version might be better if I chose a different coating for the outside.  Next time I sous vide the lamb I should take it out earlier, and use a bag that won't get water in it.
