We're gonna try even more starter this time.  I want to fill the large bread pans.







2200, night before: made pre-ferment.  Used about 4 Tbsp starter, which was 100 g.  Used 210 g flour and 240 g water to make two loaves.







0830: all ingredients in.







1030: starting bulk rise.

Bulk Rise Done





1700: finished bulk rise, in the pans now.

Starting to Rise in the Pans





2300: forgot to bake it today, oops ☺️ In the fridge now.

Ready to Bake





0730, next day: out of the fridge to warm up a bit.







1000: in the oven finally.

1040: seems to have come out about right...  Taste will tell...







Pretty great!  Nicely fluffy, not filling the bread pans but still nice.  A bit too sour maybe, actually.  I think that's from the extra rise time.
