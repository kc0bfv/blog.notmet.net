16 lbs brisket, 4 tbsp salt, 4 tbsp pepper, 2 tbsp garlic powder.

15 Nov 2200 - started the brisket at 225℉.

16 Nov 1220 - brisket is at about 180℉, turned it up to 260℉.

1220 - fish is drying after brining overnight.

1520 - brisket point is done at 208℉ (oops) so I took it off.  Flat is only at 192℉, so I upped the temp to 275℉.

1640 - flat is done at 202℉!  Perfect. 

1700 - fish is on at 120℉.

2100 - fish is off.

Everything was great!
