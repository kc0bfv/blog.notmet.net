11.19 lbs pork butt from the commissary, $2.02 per pound.  I'll use 2.75 Tbsp salt and 1.25 cups Memphis dust.  Smoking it at 225℉ until it hits about 203℉.

6 Nov, 2310: meat is on the smoker.

7 Nov, 1330: meat is at 170℉.  I'm turning the smoker up to 275℉.

1750: 201℉ - I'll take it off soon.

1810: 203℉, perfect!

Pork butt was fantastic.  Perhaps a little fattier than usual, but seems delicious.

Also doing chicken thighs.  1.68lbs.  I'll do about 1/4 tsp salt, pepper, and garlic powder per pound, plus a little MSG, similar to how I prep it for the grill, then smoke it at 225℉ until it hits 175℉.

1820: chicken is on.

1900: 150℉, I turned the smoker up to 275℉.

2010: 175℉ just about on-the-dot.

The thicker pieces of thigh seem good, the thinner pieces may be too dry.  Still all tastes good though.
