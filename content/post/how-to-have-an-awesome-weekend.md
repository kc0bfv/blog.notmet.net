Somebody gave [this post on BuzzFeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/annanorth/how-to-date-anywhere-in-the-country) the title, "How to Date Anywhere in the Country," but really it should be called, "How to Have an Awesome Weekend in the Biggest Cities in the Country".  That's not as catchy I guess.  For San Antonio it mentions the Flying Saucer, Ranger Creek Brewery, the Japanese Tea Gardens, and Candlelight Coffee.  Chicago - Millenium Park and the Art Museum.  Cleveland - Great Lakes Brewery...  Austin - Zilker Park, the Drafthouse...

These are sourced from dates posted on "howaboutwe.com", and of the places I'm familiar with, all are excellent.  But overall there aren't a ton of places listed in the infographic.  [Howaboutwe.com](http://www.howaboutwe.com/date-report/one-million-first-dates-across-america/) could make a great nightlife/tourist info website if they took all that data and just sorted it nicely.
