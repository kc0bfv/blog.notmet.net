[Google Scholar just added a citations feature](http://googlescholar.blogspot.com/2012/10/cite-from-search-results.html) which, among other things, lets you get a BibTeX formatted citation.  This is so handy, and I've wondered for a while why they didn't have that feature in there.  Often you can go to the IEEE page or whatever to get the citation, but some journals make you login (IEEE, why do you do that?) and anyway this makes one less click.


>  To copy a formatted citation, click on the “Cite” link below a search result and select from the available citation styles (currently MLA, APA, or Chicago) [...] You can also use one of the import links to import the citation into BibTeX or another bibliography manager.  We hope that simplifying the chore of citation formatting will let you focus on what you really want to work on: writing a great paper!


Thanks Goog, that is what I'd rather focus on.
