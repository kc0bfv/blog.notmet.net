This is the day for smoking corned beef!  My parents are in town and it's almost St Patty's Day, so corned beef is the perfect thing to make.  It's easy and we all like it.  Normally I boil it or bake it, baking it being my favorite way to make it so far...  This time we'll try smoking it, to which I've heard makes it fantastic.

0845: started corned beef on the smoker at 225℉

1100: top one is 138℉, bottom 126℉

1300: both are at 161℉, turned it up to 275℉

1615: top at 186℉ and bottom at 185℉

1810: 193℉ and 194℉, but it's about dinner time, so they're coming off!

This came out fantastic - although for the effort (cleanup, mostly) I think I'd just bake it next time.
