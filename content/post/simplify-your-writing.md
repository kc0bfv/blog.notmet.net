Chapter 5 in Godel, Escher, Bach, section Recursion in Language, has a great example of how my writing needed to be simplified for technical writing. It describes how asides in writing, created by commas and parentheticals, are similar to pushing and popping the writing's context to a stack. There is always a way to simplify that writing, it suggests.

Pretty smart...
