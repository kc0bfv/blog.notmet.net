How long can this string cheese sit here at the hospital entryway?

<!--more-->

* The weather won't disrupt it.
* No employees will notice this small addition to the entryway they ignore, while lost in their own thoughts.
* Nobody cleans this particular location, and it won't start to smell bad.
* No patients or family members will touch this string cheese - maybe it has germs on it.
* No animal is likely to find this food.

Sometimes I see objects like this in public, and think about this, and realize it's a cool version of hiding in plain sight.
