16 lbs brisket from the Commissary, $4.55 per lb, 4 Tbsp salt, 4 Tbsp pepper, 2 Tbsp garlic powder.

17 Oct, 1025: brisket is on at 225℉.

18 Oct, 0800: brisket is to about 188℉.

1000: brisket is to about 188℉ still.

1145: still about 188℉, and I'd rather leave the smoker at 225℉ still, so I wrapped both.

1330: now it's at 185℉!?  I turned the temperature up to 275℉.

1600: it finished while I was at the playground.  Flat is at 208℉ and point at 199℉.  Hopefully the flat is still good.

Both point and flat were great - point would have been better if I got it off sooner, of course.
