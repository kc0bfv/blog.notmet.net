Well, I've got a couple cooking projects going on today.  I'm planning to be home all day, so I've started up a lamb leg in the Sous Vide.  It's a 5 lbs New Zealand lamb leg from Costco, all tied up.



* 1 Tbsp salt
* 2 Tbsp melted butter
* 1 Tbsp (actually, a bit more) fresh rosemary
* 1 tsp pepper (or so)
* 6 big cloves of garlic
* 14 Kalmata olives

I put all that in the food processor and went until the garlic and rosemary were minced.  Then, I dropped the lamb and the paste into a Sous Vide bag, spread the paste over the lamb somewhat (I didn't do a great job with this), pulled out the air, and dropped it in the Sous Vide at 140℉ for 6 hours.  Really - it should be done after 2 or 3.  I started it cooking at 1400.

When it's done in the Sous Vide, I'll pat it dry, cut off the twine, and brown it in a cast iron skillet for about 4 minutes.  Then we'll see how good it is!  I'm gonna use some Trader Joe's freezer potatoes on the side...  I'll have to check back later with a deliciousness update.

I based this recipe on times and philosophy at [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's site](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/10/sous-vide-leg-of-lamb-mint-cumin-black-mustard-recipe.html), and the lamb leg from [Ina Garten](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/herb-roasted-lamb-recipe-1943577) that we made over Christmas.

This turned out fantastic - exactly how I wanted it.  The meat was medium, and the olives were a fantastic addition.  When searing, the olive and garlic paste, with the meat juice, turned into a fantastic sauce.  Towards the very end of the sear I added all the bag juices and simmered to get that.  Some small connective tissue was still tough to cut through with a butter knife, not sure if this is something inherent, or if I can fix that, or if some other hunk of meat just wouldn't have that.

For next time:



1. Sarah wants lamb to be more well done. Go for medium well, for her.
2. If adding olives, don't add other salt.  It was not too salty, by any means, but might be just a little better with a bit less.

\[…\] the sous vide one, I used the same recipe as previously, but forgot to not add extra salt with the olives. Oh \[…\]
