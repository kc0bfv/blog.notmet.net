[Based on this recipe](https://honest-food.net/how-to-smoke-salmon-recipe/)

Meat: two approx. 2.5 lbs filets of of salmon (totalling 5 lbs), skin off.

Brine: 1 quart cool water, 1/3 cup sea salt, 1 cup brown sugar

Baste: maple syrup

Starting smoker temp: 120℉

Desired end temp: 130-140℉

The night before, slice each filet into thirds, and distribute between two ziploc bags of brine (half the brine in each bag).  Place the brine in the fridge overnight.

At least two hours before smoking, pour out the brine, pat-dry the fish (with paper-towel), and arrange it separated in the fridge so it can dry for those two hours.

When it's time to smoke, get the smoker up to temperature, and get it really smoking.  Because the temp is really low you may need to leave the door open just before you put the fish on.  That will cause the temp to drop, so the smoker turns the heater element on long enough to burn the chips.

Put the fish on at 120℉ for 2 hours, then 140℉ for 1 hour, then 175℉ for 1 more hour.  After each hour, baste the fish with maple syrup.  When I follow this regimen I've always hit about 140℉ right on time.
