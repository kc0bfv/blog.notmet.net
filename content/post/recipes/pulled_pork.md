[Based on this recipe](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/pork-recipes/perfect-pulled-pork-recipe/).

Salt: .5 tsp per pound

Rub: About 1/2 cup per 5 pounds [Meathead's Memphis Dust]({{< relref "post/recipes/meatheads-memphis-dust.md" >}})

Starting smoker temp: 225℉

Desired end temp: 203℉

Start the smoker.  Salt and rub into a shaker, shake it onto every exposed surface of the butt.  Put the butt in the smoker and let it go for a long time.  Check it at least 12 hours before you want to eat, you may need to turn the smoker up to 275℉ to get it done on time.  For a 15 lbs butt it regularly takes 18 hours even with turning up the smoker 6 halfway-through.  Let it rest a little, then pull it.

To serve for pulled pork sammies, it can be fun to put it in a crock pot with a generous number of butter patts, and a little sauce (not enough for people to realize you sauced it).
