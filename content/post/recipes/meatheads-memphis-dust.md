This is a rub that I commonly use for pulled pork and ribs, but it's good on poultry too.

Original recipe: [Meathead's Memphis Dust](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/spice-rubs-and-pastes/meatheads-memphis-dust-rub-recipe/)

Ingredients:
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 3/4 cup white sugar
* 1/2 cup paprika (smoked, I prefer, but any)
* 1/4 cup garlic powder
* 2 Tbsp black pepper
* 2 Tbsp ground ginger powder
* 2 Tbsp onion powder (I usually skip this)
* 1 Tbsp rosemary

Mix it all up in a bag.
