[Based on this recipe](https://heygrillhey.com/recipe/texas-style-smoked-beef-brisket/).

Meat: get a full brisket, a packer brisket, with both point and flat.

Seasoning: 1/4 Tbsp per pound salt, 1/4 Tbsp per pound black pepper, 1/8 Tbsp per pound garlic powder.

Starting smoker temp: 225℉

Desired end temp: 203℉

Start the smoker.  Trim up the brisket so there's about 1/4 inch of fat, max, on surfaces.  Maybe cut the brisket in half to fit the smoker - either separate point from flat or just cut it in half.  Put the seasoning in a shaker and shake it onto every exposed surface.  Put it on the smoker with the point (fattier piece) on top, and the fatty sides on both up.  Remember which temp probe is in which piece.

This will take sometimes more than 24 hours.  Check early whether you want to turn up the temp.  When the meat hits the stall (often around 175℉ -ish) you may want to wrap it in peach butcher paper.  You don't have to though.  If you wrap, give yourself a big enough piece of paper such that you can easily wrap, you can do it in a way where you only lift the meat by holding the paper, too, and avoid getting anything else dirty.

The stall can be a good time to turn up the temp, in my experience.

The flat will reach temperature before the point.  Ideally, take the flat off when it hits temp, then keep cooking the point until it also hits.  Let it rest before slicing.
