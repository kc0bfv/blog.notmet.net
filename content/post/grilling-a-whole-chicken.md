We have a leftover chicken in the freezer, so it's time to grill up a whole chicken again!  We thawed it in the fridge over a couple days, then I marinated it in a bottle of Jerk sauce.  I still haven't found a great bottle of Jerk sauce - none are even approaching the right spiciness.  Oh well.  The chicken is medium sized, not as large as a roaster.







1910: Started butterflied chicken on the grill, cold side, skin up, legs towards the fire.  I drizzled the bag of marinade over the raw chicken.  When the breasts hit 130℉ and the legs 145℉ or so, I'll flip it over and hit the skin for 5 minutes until breasts are 145℉ or so.







1940: Breasts are at 110℉.







2000: Breasts are between 131℉ and 145℉ - time to flip it and crisp the skin.







2005: Taking chicken off to rest 10 minutes.







Delicious.  After it rested, I sliced it up and put on more Jerk sauce.  I heated up the sauce before basting it on.  Definitely do that again.
