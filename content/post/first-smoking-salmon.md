Some notes from the first time I used the smoker - I made smoked salmon.  The result was awesome - I've made it a couple times since then, and am just dropping this here for future note.

I really just followed the instructions.  I used Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, as he recommends - which, BTW, is probably going to become my goto salt.  I used Costco salmon without the skin on - it worked perfectly.  I brined in Ziploc bags - no problem.  The whole thing came out perfectly.  I think I only brined for a few hours, then dried for a few hours.  Since then, I've brined and dried for longer, but this first batch of fish really needed no improvement.
