Just before the holidays a new high profile vulnerability dropped - log4shell.  This seemed like a good opportunity to build an exploitation practice range for a few reasons:

* chance to experiment with the vulnerability
* example cloud-deployment range I can show to my office
* solves a problem others might ask about at work
* possible convention talk topic

# TODO walk through the existing slides as a blog post
