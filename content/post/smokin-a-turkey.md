Alright!  It's Christmas!  I meant to do this a week ago, but the turkey was still frozen, so we're doing it today.  If it turns out terrible we'll be eating Chinese for dinner.







I got a pre-brined 12 lbs turkey for less than $1 per pound, put olive oil on the skin, then sprinkled on the rub I use on pork butt because it's similar to what [this person recommends](https://heygrillhey.com/smoked-turkey/) anyway.  We'll smoke it at 225℉, and it should take about 6 hours at that temperature.  We've got temperature probes in the turkey, so we should know when it's done.







1020: bird on the smoker, smoke holes half open.







1620: it's chugging along nicely.  The places where I originally put the temperature probes are over-temp now, by a little, but the base of the breast is still at 161℉.  I moved a probe to that spot.  We have sides cooking too, so I bumped the temp to 275℉ to get it done a little quicker.







1700: all done!  It was juicy, delicious, and we have a bunch leftover.  The rub was a fine choice, although it's not adding all that much to the turkey.  Adding more flavor through a brine or rub could be good next time.
