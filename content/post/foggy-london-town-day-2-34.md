Ok, enough of that shit.  Sarah and I are in London, England!

This is the end of our second full day here, and I'm pleased to say we didn't sleep in too much.  Today we got going around 930, down to Silvia's Corner, a real foodie's breakfast place near our Airbnb. Well, the foodiest place nearby.  This was a great place to stop for both of us.  Sarah got a juice and this eggs and chorizo and toast thing that was fantastic, and I got a greasy ass plate of buttered toast, bacon, sausage and eggs.  Delicious.




{{< iframe caption="Sylvia's Corner - we highly recommend this place" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d9931.988788216044!2d-0.04356616998168526!3d51.51326741904732!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x735ad38883aff4ce!2sSylvia's+Corner!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1512239768684" >}}




After breakfast we took the light rail down to Greenwich and checked out the Cutty Sark, the observatory, and the Queen's House.  They were working on the rigging on the ship, and you get to walk all over it.  They've setup fantastic animations and museum games down in the hold.  Over at the observatory you can stand on the prime meridian, and see some of the original clocks that enabled naval navigation.  The Queen's House is now an art museum. It's open to visitors for free.

For lunch we stopped at the Greenwich market, which is full of kitschy shops and street food places.  Sarah browsed the shops while I looked around for which Indian food place was the best.  We had samosas and a Chicken Tikka wrap while sitting in the warm sunlight.  We grabbed coffees before hoping back on the light rail and heading in toward the Tower of London.

We spent about two hours hanging around at the Tower. This place is a castle that is almost entirely open to the public.  Beefeaters are living here still, giving tours, and our tour guide Spike was hilarious.  This guy knew his history and knew how to entertain. We had a great time, and followed the tour up with a self-guided exploration within the walls.  The Tower Bridge raised up at one point to let a boat through - you can find the Tower Bridge raising times scheduled out on their website, and you can find great views of the tower bridge at the tower of London.

Now we're sitting in a pub just back from a main drag, called Draft House Seething.  Great place.

Yesterday began with us walking up late.  No worries mate.  I went on what accidentally became a six mile run, but I got to see a good chunk of the city.  The Millennium Bridge, Shakespeare's Globe Theater, Tower Bridge.  Well, we had seen Tower Bridge the night before.  There was a place playing London Bridge is Falling Down under London Bridge.  It was on a loopie doopie as they call it here in gay old London town.

Anyway, after that we picked up a couple London Passes, which we have been using ever since.  They're basically prepaid entry to more places that you can ever visit. But we knew we were going to visit a bunch of them.  On that first full day, Churchill's War Rooms, Westminster Abbey, the National Portrait Gallery (which is free anyway), Big Ben is down there too, but he's under construction.  You know why the ladies call him Big Ben right?

The caption explained that she didn't love many portraits of her, but she liked this artist for it, and she liked this portrait.  I agree - it says so much about her." caption="Queen Elizabeth's Portrait" >}}

We went to dinner around there, and some sort of London Film Fest was happening.  So of course we had dinner with Kate Winslet and Sarah drew her like she draws me, her French girl.

Dinner at Waxy's Little Sister, this pub with good food and an upstairs couch lounge.  We walked around and stopped by Sherlock's house, which is a museum at 221b Baker Street.  That was a short stop away on the Tubey Wubey, as they call it here in Foggy Londonnerville.

I'm sticking to my doctor prescribed one-cask-ale-a-day prescription.  It's tough but I think I'm the man to accomplish it.

Titty titty ta ta for now, as they say here in Queener-do-ville.
