[Here's](http://www.federicopereiro.com/masters/) a list of great papers in Computer Science.  There are some great papers on there, but one thing missing is the book, [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).  That's not exactly a paper, I suppose, but it is one of the most influential programming books.

Regarding books that I need to read, [here's](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2012/07/88-books-that-shaped-america-at-the-library-of-congress.html/) a list of 88 books that influenced America.  I need to remember to read some of those, along with The Old Man and the Sea...  I guess I just need to finish that last one at some point...
