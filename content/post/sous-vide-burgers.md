 	  * 1.5 Tbsp Worcester sauce per pound of meat
 	  * 2 Tbsp Duke's Mayo per pound of meat
 	  * .5 Tbsp minded garlic per pound of meat
 	  * 85% Ground Beef

Tonight we're trying this recipe, and I made 8 7.5 oz burgers, starting from almost 3.5 lbs beef.  I dropped all but two bagged burgers into the deep freeze, and dropped the other two in the indoors freezer, and then sous-vide'd those two at 130° for 1 hour, so they should come out on the rare side of medium.  The others I'll save for another day.  After sous-vide'ing, I will crisp up the outsides for about 1 minute each side in a hot cast iron skillet.

These recipes are adapted from:

The result?  A delicious burger, definitely.  There were a few problems though:

 	  1. I should have seared the burgers just a little better.
 	  2. I should have followed Kenji's recommendation about not using any type of vacuum sealer on the burgers - I used mine gently, but next time I should just immerse.
 	  3. Next time I should use more lean burger meat - these are too juicy.
 	  4. Make smaller patties next time, or use bigger buns, or a little of both.  I put a bunch of stuff on there with the burger, but it just would not all stay on there.  Very messy delicious.
