Here's today's recipe!  Based on a couple things:






 	  1. The recipe my mom sent me called Amway Grand Plaza Grilled Chicken Midwest - in my Google Docs Recipes folder
 	  2. [https://ohsweetbasil.com/how-to-smoke-chicken/](https://ohsweetbasil.com/how-to-smoke-chicken/)

Other great info and ideas at these links - at some point I'd like to try the brine/minimal method:

 	  2. [https://www.traegergrills.com/recipes/poultry/whole-smoked-chicken](https://www.traegergrills.com/recipes/poultry/whole-smoked-chicken)

Anyway - here's the plan today.  Make a marinade of the ingredients below, divide this among four butterflied (spatchcocked?  silly name) chickens in plastic bags, marinade overnight.  Then, smoke for four hours at 220℉, with the goal of getting internal temp on the breasts to 160℉-165℉.  Let the chicken rest, then carve it up.

Marinade - this is a simplified tripled version of the recipe (almost as the recipe suggests to do):

 	  * 3 cups apple juice
 	  * 3 cups oil
 	  * 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
 	  * 3/4 cup soy sauce
 	  * 1/2 cup lemon juice
 	  * 1/2 cup chopped parsley
 	  * 1/2 cup chopped carrot
 	  * 1.5 cloves garlic, minced
 	  * 3/4 tsp peppercorns (I'm gonna grind black pepper here)
 	  * 3 dashes Worchestershire sauce
 	  * 1 bay leaf per chicken

I was able to find four approximately 4 lbs chickens at Costco for $.99 a pound.  While there, though, I decided to also grab the salmon...  It looked really nice, so I figured I might as well - save myself a little effort next weekend.

1820, 10 Feb: Finished prepping the chicken - they're marinating in bags in the fridge.  I need to get better ziploc bags next time - actual ziploc ones.

1850, 10 Feb: Finished prepping the salmon, and it's in the fridge brining.

0315, 11 Feb: Birds went on.  I added wood at 0530.

0715: Birds were 157℉.  I decided to leave them on until 0745 - then I realized that I forgot to begin the fish drying, so...

0730: Fish began drying.  I'm going to shorten the drying time by 30 min...

0750: Took the chicken off.  It had only risen to about 159℉ in that time - I really need a thermometer that stays in the meat, and is readable with the door shut.

0840: The chicken is delicious - I had a little right off the smoker and it just all comes apart easily.  In this time, I've cleaned the smoker a bit, and restarted it at 170℉.  The fish looks ready to go on, despite shortened dry time, so I'll turn the temp down, open the smoke holes all the way like I thought about doing last time, and put it on at 0900, then carve up the chicken.

1300: Took the fish off.  It was at 147℉, which is hotter than desired...  Everything seems fine with it though - it stayed moist and didn't give up much.  The flavor seems a little stronger, initially - smokier.  I like it, but time will tell if this is better.  The temperature seemed to be running a little hotter each time I checked it, this time, compared to others.

For next time:

 	  * Get in-meat thermometer, butcher paper, and knife sharpener.
 	  * If I end up liking this fish better, keep the vent holes half-open next time.  But - try to take the fish off a little earlier.

Now, I'm a little tired.
