15.5 pound brisket, $3.78 per pound, Sam's in Idaho Falls, 4 Tbsp salt, 4 Tbsp pepper, 2 Tbsp garlic powder.  Gonna put them on at 225℉ to start.

1810, 9 Nov: brisket on the smoker.

1830: sourdough is fermenting.

2200: flat is at 160℉, point at 142℉.

0210, 10 Nov: flat is 166℉, point 164℉.  Crutched it!

0730: flat is 186℉, point 187℉.  Turned temperature up to 250℉.

0845: put the rest of the ingredients in the bread.  I've continued doing the 1 tsp regular yeast along with the sourdough starter, and doubling sourdough starter over the Josie Baker recommendation.

0930: flat is 201℉, point 200℉.  Almost there!

1000: both are at 202℉.  Just one degree more!

1045: sourdough starting bulk rise.

1110: brisket at 203℉.  Taking it off.

Cleaned up, sliced up, gotta cool a bit...

1400: sourdough in the pan for final rise.

1712: sourdough in the oven.

Now brisket sandwiches will be almost from scratch...  Everything except cheese and BBQ sauce
