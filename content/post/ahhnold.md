Why does Arnold Schwarzenegger rock so much? I'm sitting on the couch, watching True Lies and Jamie Lee Curtis is trying to screw around with another man. Why? Because she doesn't know the true Arnold. For those who haven't seen the movie, Schwarzenwhatever is a spy for the US. Come on, ladies love that kinda stuff, right? Anyway, what is Curtis thinking?

Then there's his other movie. Commando. What is the most awesome part of Commando? I think the correct question is, what isn't the most awesome part of Commando. Arnold is an ex-Army commando-Colonel who trained a bunch of special forces geeks. Special forces geeks you say? Yes. One wears t-shirt chain mail the entire movie. The rest of them get killed right at the beginning.

I guess he made some others too, like Total Recall. That takes place on Mars.

In conclusion, Arnold Schwarzenegger is totally awesome. He has been to Mars. That's more than I can say for any other human.
