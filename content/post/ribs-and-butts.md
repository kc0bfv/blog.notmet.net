I haven't made ribs since 2018, apparently.  Let's do ribs again!  And a pork butt later.  I have been wanting ribs for a while, but haven't done em.  The wife isn't a fan of ribs.  And - last time I did them it [didn't go so great](https://blog.notmet.net/tags/ribs/). But I have learned from that time.  This time I only bought one package of ribs from Costco, 3 racks.  St Louis style, 11.41 lbs, $2.89 per pound.  I'll smoke them at 250℉ until they hit 203℉.  I might have smoked them at 225℉ but I have a time limit today...

Pork butt is 15.76 lbs at $2.49 per pound.  I'll use 4 Tbsp salt and 1.75 cups Memphis Dust.

1006, 31 Aug: Starting the smoker and prep.  3 Tbsp salt (1 per 4 lbs), 12 Tbsp Memphis dust.  Salt first then rub.

1645: 178℉ and 181℉ in the meat, and it has stalled here for several hours.  Next time consider wrapping them.   For now I've turned up the temperature to 275℉, and I will plan to grill them with BBQ sauce on them here when the pork butt needs to go on.

1745: moving the ribs to the cool side of the grill, mopping them with BBQ sauce.

1745 also: Putting the butt on the smoker at 225℉.

0920, 1 Sep: pork is at 174℉ and 176℉.

1030ish: I bumped the temperature up to 250℉.

1510: 201℉ and 196℉.

1730: 199℉ and 204℉, close enough!

The ribs came out amazing.  "The best ribs I've ever had," Sarah said, and the girls liked them too.  They were moist, but the thinner parts definitely got more done than needed.  I think pulling the thin parts earlier would have made sense, so maybe put a temperature probe in the thin part and one in a thick part next time.

The butt is amazing as always.  Gigi loves making pulled pork tacos out of them, we put the parts on her plate and she assembles them herself.  She at the heck out of 'em.
