Well, there's the possibility that the brisket I did last weekend won't be enough meat...  And there's the fact that I can get another one done in time...  So I'm making another brisket!  We'll just try for a repeat performance...

14.1 lbs of brisket at $3.99 a pound...

1045, 21 Jul: Brisket went on, fat cap up, 225℉.  I should check the temperature after 8 hours, at 0645.

0900, 22 Jul: The flat passed 166℉ a couple hours ago, but the point was only at 162℉.  Now, the flat is at about 175℉, while the point is at 165℉...  I wrapped it and increased the smoker temperature to 250℉.  This step took a little longer than last time, but then I was doing to finish up further ahead of the party than I wanted anyway, so the timing should be ok.  After wrapping I kept the fat cap on top.

1200 or so: Brisket got up to temperature, the lean got there first by about 30 minutes.

The party was fantastic!  We had a great time with all the friends that showed up.  We ate almost all of both briskets, leaving only a small container in the end.  I'm very glad I smoked this second one.
