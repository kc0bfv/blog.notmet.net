I don't make sourdough posts every time I make sourdough, anymore.  It's a routine now.

But this morning I'm going to try a little experiment.  I have preferment for two loaves, and I'm going to add different amounts of whole wheat flour to them in the next stage.  Normally I add no whole wheat flour, but I would like the loaves to rise a little more than usual, without waiting more time, and whole wheat flour jazzes the little guys up, so I think this might work.

Normally I use 375g bread flour.  In the glass bowl I will use 150g whole wheat flour and 225g bread flour (totaling the original weight).  In the other bowl I'll use the original recipe, 375g bread flour.

Initially, at 0730, they look pretty similar.

Their rise occurred at about the same rate.

Unfortunately I don't have two large bread pans that are the same size...  I put the glass bowl dough into the gold colored pan.

The smaller pan was ready to bake earlier, at 1830, but I suspect it hasn't actually risen faster, it's just in a smaller pan.

I popped the gold pan in the oven at 1930.

That's the gold pan's completed loaf there in the back...  It has risen only about the normal amount, so the experiment failed.

The bread did still taste good.
