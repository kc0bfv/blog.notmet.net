One of my best buddies got us some steaks for our wedding, and now it's time to smoke a couple of them!  Four of the steaks are half pound fillet mignons, so I'm smoking two.  I'm wrapping two slices of applewood bacon around each steak, putting 1/4 tsp salt on each, and smoking them at 225℉.  I'll use the thermometers, smoking them to 130℉, then searing top and bottom on cast iron.







1645: Steaks on!  Initial internal temperature, 60℉.







1710: Steak at 90℉.







1725: Steak at 114℉.







1745: Steak at 133℉, taking it off to get a sear.







The result is fantastic, buttery, delicious, medium rare, smoky.  Next time I would leave Sarah's on until medium well, this time I just microwaved it gently for her.  Ideally, next time I would put it on the grill towards the end, to crisp the bacon like she likes it.  Also, each fillet only needed one strip of bacon.
