We were out of sourdough once again, so it was time to make some fresh!  About halfway through I realized we didn't have enough of the bread flour I needed.  Instead of 375g, I put in the 200g we had, then about 75g whole wheat flour and 100g all purpose flour.

And how did it turn out?  The dough rose as normal, baked as normal, and tastes almost normal.  The result is maybe a little tougher than usual, and slightly darker.  It's still great though.
