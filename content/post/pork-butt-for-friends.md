We've got some of Sarah's best friends in town, and some of their family is coming over Sunday, so I'm busting out the smoker to feed everybody.  Time for some pulled pork!







2030, Friday: salted the 15 lbs butt with 2.5 Tbsp salt.  It's in the fridge now until Saturday night, when I'll put 1 cup rub on and start it smoking at 225℉.







2215, Saturday: put the butt on the smoker at 225℉, after putting the rub on.







0820, Sunday: temperatures are 166℉ (top) and 162℉.







1015: temperatures are 167℉ and 163℉.  We're deep in the stall now...







1100: turned up the smoker to 275℉.







1330: meat is at 190℉ and 181℉.







1500: meat is at 197℉ and 188℉.  Pork butt really takes a long time.







1510: took the top one off at 198℉.







1700 or so: took the second off at 203℉.







It came out awesome!  Note that 20 hours would not have been enough time without cranking the temperature.  Next time, just plan on cranking the temperature.
