Just got married, just got honeymooned, just got back to work... Time for some food!

17 lbs brisket, $61, 6 lbs salmon $9 per pound. Using the same recipe as usual.

2120: Brisket went on the smoker. 4.5 Tbsp salt, 4.5 Tbsp pepper, 2.25 Tbsp garlic powder.

2200: Fish is brining.

0530: Brisket at 165 and 166. Crutched it, and turned temperature up to 250. Also, moved fish to drying.

0845: Brisket at 202 and 189.

0930: Took the flat off, it was done, at 208.

1130: I've checked the point temperature periodically this whole time, and it has slowly risen to 201. I'll take it off after making coffee.

1145: Point was at 201, close enough, took it off then cleaned the smoker grates and water tray, and removed and chunks. Set it to reheat to 120.

1230: Fish is on!

1630: All done, delicious.

Next time I need to make sure I slice across the grain. I mistook the direction of the grain in some of the brisket, I need to double check that next time. Otherwise I think it all turned out fantastically.
