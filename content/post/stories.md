During this leadership development course one of the instructors quoted one of his previous mentors saying that leaders should have stories ready about:

> mission, discipline, loyalty, and safety

This is in line with what one of my former mentors told me more briefly, "you need stories".  Ok - I thought, but stories about what?  I have stories...  I can tell a story...  Typically I'm coming up with something appropriate on the spot.  There are pros and cons to that approach.

This recommendation seems a lot more actionable.  Here are four areas that I can think about in advance and plan to have stories ready for when necessary.  I'm not sure when I'd be interested in talking about loyalty - to me that word has taken on an extremely negative connotation.  Perhaps by reflecting a bit on stories where I found loyalty positive, I'll find a way to revise that negative connotation.

So - I need to take some time to come up with these stories, and write down versions to share in a journal.
