We got 4.2 lbs of lamb chops from Costco because they were out of lamb legs.  I plan to just try the regular recipe with a little less salt than last time.

Rub is:

* 8 cloves of garlic
* 3 Tbsp sea salt
* 2 Tbsp pepper
* 1.5 tsp oregano
* 2 tsp thyme
* 2 tsp rosemary (from the garden!)
* 4 Tbsp olive oil

Put it all in the food processor then paint it on the lamb, then put it on the smoker at 275℉ (was supposed to be 250℉ but I screwed up) until it hits 160℉.

1510: smoker heating up after some trouble with the GFCI outlets - they were breaking open when the heating element turned on.  Not a good sign for the smoker...

1550: on the smoker.

1630: well, they were actually on at 275℉ because of the problems with the smoker.  Oops.  They're at 160℉ now so I turned the heat down to 200℉ and am letting them roll for a bit.

1720: took the lamb off.  It was fantastic.
