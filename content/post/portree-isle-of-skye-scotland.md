I pushed the accelerator of the Peugeot 3008 to the floor, as I slammed it from fifth into third to accelerate up the hill and around the corner while the rock wall on the passenger side caused the proximity sensor to light and the lorry passed within inches on the driver's side.  Lock one, lock two, Loch Lomond on the right and an ancient wall on the left.

Driving in Scotland was terrifying for the five hours it took to go those first 200 miles up to Portree.  The roads are too narrow for an SUV, and 18-wheelers are cruising along at 60. Which is the speed limit.  Roads twist every 50 feet, it's raining, and the locals are having none of your hesitation.  They're very politely having none of your hesitation.

So don't hesitate, and don't screw up. Just go. Faster.

This was a stressful, demanding five hours. There are regular stops, even a few in the middle of nowhere, and everybody can make a good espresso (thank the gods for coffee in Europe). Sarah was accommodating though. And the vehicle had sensors which helped me stay in my lane and on the road.  It also had this awesome thing which indicated the speed limit very accurately at every place. Once I figured out the cruise control, it also integrated automatically into that.

My feet would get soaked, but I could do it." caption="Fields at a Rest Stop" >}}

Portree was a beauty. We stayed at Grenitote B&B, booked through Airbnb, and had a wonderful time. The town is charming, and our host even more so.  He gave us a choice of breakfast, and we got smoked salmon with scrambled eggs toast and coffee.  He sprinkled beetroot powder and blueberries on top, which was unexpectedly amazing.

How to see Skye...


[http://www.earthtrekkers.com/perfect-isle-of-skye-itinerary](http://www.earthtrekkers.com/perfect-isle-of-skye-itinerary)


We followed their day two recommendations, fairly precisely.  I really wanted to see Talisker, and we were not disappointed.  Fairy Pools were beautiful too... I've got nothing, word wise, but you can check out my pictures. The short hike is very rewarding.  Neist Point was a great short hike too, but not Fairy Pools.

The high point of our visit, though, was Dunvegan Castle. This is the seat of the Highlander.

The chief of can McLeod was in while we were visiting his castle. We didn't run into the guy, but still got to look around his beautiful place. Even more impressive than the castle were the gardens. There are at least six distinct gardens, each with a different focus, all gorgeous, all impressive.

Our itinerary up on Skye was awesome.  Not difficult to stay on schedule, but we still got to see a ton.  We had haggis twice up on Skye, and it was great both times.

On our return to Glasgow, we stayed at the Alamo Guest House. This place is luxurious. I was looking forward to spending some time here, if only for a soak in the tub, and we were not disappointed.

We departed Glasgow through their airport, headed to Dublin. Glasgow's airport is setup similar to Stansted, with great security and terrible duty-free.  I held back my vomit long enough to make it through the nightmare that was the airport mall, and fortunately it was shorter than Stansted's.  Ryanair had a delay that was very poorly communicated, but otherwise we flew to Dublin without incident.

Dublin! Next post.
