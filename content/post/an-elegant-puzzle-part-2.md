I'm continuing to read an Elegant Puzzle and chapter 3 had some good considerations regarding defining teams and groups during a reorg that I think are good guidelines for building teams more generally:

* Consider team sizes and management spread.
* Can you write a crisp mission statement for each team?
* Can you define clear interfaces for each team?
* Can you list the areas of ownership for each team?
* Is each responsibility owned by a team?
* Would you personally be excited to be a member of each team, as well as to be the manager?
* Put teams that work together close.  Especially if they work poorly.  This minimizes distance for escalation, and reduces info gaps.
* Are there compelling candidate pitches for each team?
* Are you over-optimizing on individuals, vs establishing a sensible structure?

And, 5 minute media training:

* Answer the question you want to be asked - re-frame a difficult or challenging question into one you're comfortable answering.  Don't accept a question's implicit framing, take the opportunity to frame it yourself.
* Stay positive - especially when it comes to competitors and controversy.
* Speak in threes - three concise points, continue to refer back to them.

Chapter 4 - philosophy for management.  This is the author's philosophy:

* The golden rule makes a lot of sense
* Give everyone an explicit area of ownership they are responsible for
* Reward and status should derive from *finishing* high-quality work
* Lead from the front, never ask anyone to do something you wouldn't

And later:

* Management is an ethical profession, so remember that your actions have a profound impact on those around you
* Strong relationships are greater than any problem
* People over process - "with the right people any process works, with the wrong people no process works"
* Do the hard thing now - double down on the hard parts, don't avoid them
* Do the right thing for your company, your team, yourself - in that order
* Think for yourself

These are pretty reasonable personal philosophies of leadership.
