Just yesterday I smoked some lamb, and today I'm starting a pork butt for a get-together tomorrow night.  14.2 lbs at $2.29/lb from Costco.  I'll use 1.5 cups dust and 2.5 Tbsp salt, similar to last time.

2015: started the smoker with hickory chips at 225℉

2050: meat is on the smoker!  And it's actually set to 225℉ this time.  Marked probe is on top.

0730: 169℉ and 173℉

0930: 171℉ and 180℉ - raising the temp to 275℉

1130: 190℉ and 205℉, almost there!  I'll trust the 190℉.

1300: 199℉ and 210℉, hopefully both are perfect, taking them off
