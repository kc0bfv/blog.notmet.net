        <p>Time to try some ribs!  I&rsquo;ll use <a href="https://masterbuilt.com/recipes/pork-or-baby-back-ribs">this recipe</a> with the <a href="https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/spice-rubs-and-pastes/meatheads-memphis-dust-rub-recipe">Memphis Dust</a> dry rub I used on the pork butts.  Also - we&rsquo;re out of Salmon.  I&rsquo;m going to do a double batch of the usual.  I&rsquo;ll just do 6 pounds for four hours, then do 6 more for 4 more hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.notmet.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180505_190255-e1525627185151.jpg"><img src="https://blog.notmet.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180505_190255-225x300.jpg" alt="The inside of the smoker before starting.">
</a></p>
<p>I bought what I thought were 3 racks of ribs - 3 large vacuum-packed things of ribs from Costco.  About 30 lbs total.  What I didn&rsquo;t realize is that each vacuum packed bag contains 3 racks of ribs&hellip;  So I&rsquo;m going to do 9 racks of ribs.  This is stupid and I almost certainly don&rsquo;t have enough room in the smoker, but it&rsquo;ll all work out :-)</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.notmet.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/received_10157063550895021-e1525627308646.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.notmet.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/received_10157063550895021-300x225.jpeg" alt="Nine racks of ribs on cutting boards.">
</a></p>
<p>1900, 5 May 2018: Started the smoker at 225℉ and started washing, salting and dry-rubbing the ribs.  I used 1/2 tsp salt per pound, although didn&rsquo;t get it as evenly-distributed as I&rsquo;d like.  I wish I had salted these earlier, but we don&rsquo;t have the fridge space or the time.  I used up all the remaining dry rub from the earlier pork butts.</p>
<p>1950: Prep of the ribs is done, and they&rsquo;re on the smoker.  The smoker is ridiculously full.  The ribs are leaning on each other.  This is silly&hellip;</p>
<p>2000: Beginning prep of salmon.</p>
<p>2040: Prep done, went and checked the ribs.  The smoker says the temperature is only 165℉&hellip;  That seems very unusual to me.  Typically, the smoker takes only a short time to return to temperature.  I tried to slide the racks away from the back wall, thinking that maybe something was in contact with the thermometer for the smoker.  I don&rsquo;t believe that was the case.  I believe that the meat is restricting the flow of air too much.  I moved meat out from the back wall and opened the vent fully.  The smoker feels like it isn&rsquo;t very hot&hellip;  The meat at the bottom though is quite warm.  There are two temperature probes in place.  One registers a meat temp of 120℉, and the other 75℉.  I think the former is in contact with bone, but it&rsquo;s also likely that it&rsquo;s the lower probe and the meat is actually hotter than the other meat.  This is going to cause a problem for me.  I don&rsquo;t want some ribs to be much more done than the others.  I don&rsquo;t want them to be cooked quickly.  I want slow cooked&hellip;  Hopefully the smoker airflow will work better and temperature will equalize, permitting the smoker element to turn off.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>2100: I opened the door again and used the other temperature probe on the meats.  The other probe, placed in meat on each level, registered between 133℉ and 140℉.  The probes in the meat registered 150℉ and 105℉.  I&rsquo;m going to assume that the actual meat temp is 133℉ to 140℉, and that the probes are in parts of the meat that isn&rsquo;t very representative of the correct temperature.  Most importantly - the meat is cooking at a somewhat consistent temperature throughout the smoker.</p>
<p>2200: I removed the bottom half of all the ribs - they were past the temperature I&rsquo;d hoped to achieve, the smoker still hadn&rsquo;t reached temperature, the lowest ribs looked like they were starting to burn.  Burn!  In a smoker.  Craziness.  I thought that by removing the bottom half I&rsquo;d allow more smoke to circulate and bring the temperature up.  I tasted these ribs that were removed.  The ribs closest to the burner, and hottest, were tender and good.  They were almost what I&rsquo;d hoped for.  The ribs slightly further away were tougher.  Still good, but not quite what I&rsquo;d wanted.  I left the remaining half on for another hour, despite the other half already being at the desired temperature.</p>
<p>2300: I removed the other half of the ribs.  This second half seems to be as consistently tender as the hottest ribs in the bottom half.  This is what I&rsquo;d hoped to achieve.  I&rsquo;m happy, even if this did not go anywhere near plan.</p>
<p>0710, 6 May 2018: First 6 lbs of fish went into drying.</p>
<p>1126: Fish went on the smoker.  I didn&rsquo;t clean the smoker at all - I dumped the water pan and refilled it.  This may impart some pork seasoning to the fish.  We&rsquo;ll see.  I doubt it&rsquo;ll be bad though.</p>
<p>1136: Second half of fish is drying now.  The smoker is definitely burning up some of that pork fat that was in there.  Hopefully that doesn&rsquo;t impart a bad flavor to the fish.</p>
<p>1226: A lot less smoking from the pork remains, at this point.  I basted the fish - it&rsquo;s clear that they cooked pretty hot for the first hour.  There is much more albumin than expected on them right now.  I&rsquo;m not too worried though, it&rsquo;s not too far off that second time I smoked salmon.  They might be done a little early.</p>
<p>1326: Turned temp up and basted.  Normal amount of albumin.</p>
<p>1426: Went out to turn the temperature up and baste the fish, and checked their temperatures on a lark.  The fish was done!  It was at the mid-high range of its intended temperature.  I brought it all in without basting it again.  I suspected that the smoker had been running a bit hot the entire time - especially at the beginning.  I think that beginning heat supercharged everything and the fish finished faster.  It tastes good&hellip;</p>
<p>1440: The rest of the fish is on.</p>
<p>1540: Lots of albumin again, it was probably burning hot again&hellip;</p>
<p>1740: Once again - right before I crank the heat to the top value, the fish is done.  Temperature is perfect, I pulled it off.  Tastes good.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is possible to overfill a smoker.</li>
<li>Clean some of the fat out of the smoker between goes so it doesn&rsquo;t burn so hot.</li>
<li>Sarah doesn&rsquo;t like as smokey as the chicken got last time - this salmon may be too smokey for her, too.  Hopefully not.  Love that woman.</li>

<p>Next time, look out for the ribs membrane on the bottom. I have not noticed this while eating these, but maybe removing it, if it&rsquo;s there, will be even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/I-RL">https://youtu.be/I-RL</a>_f8qdJE</p>

<p>Sous vide ribs are also a thing to try. <a href="https://skillet.lifehacker.com/you-can-make-these-smoky-sous-vide-ribs-without-a-gril-1826330999/amp">https://skillet.lifehacker.com/you-can-make-these-smoky-sous-vide-ribs-without-a-gril-1826330999/amp</a> Those look better than smoked. However, that&rsquo;s probably because I epically screwed up these smoked ribs. Not that they aren&rsquo;t still awesome ribs, just, ribs are awesome to begin with.</p>
