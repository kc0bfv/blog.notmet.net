      <description>In computer security, there are three main axes for consideration - confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). These are commonly thought of as things you desire out of a secure system. You want your communications to only be available to the intended agents, you want them to remain unchanged except when you intend them to change, and you want them to be available when you need them. Preferably, you want your communications to have all of those properties.</description>

      <description>It looks like https://github.com/nixawk/labs/issues/19 is being exploited like crazy right now. I was getting hits trying to exploit it every 4 hours or so, then the rate sped up for a time. Each hit was trying to download drupal.php from http://51.254.219.134.
Somebody has nulled out that file now, so infection rate will probably drop.</description>
