      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back in Texas! And Sarah&amp;rsquo;s living here for the first time. She had only visited, previously. I&amp;rsquo;ve already taken her to a local BBQ place that was great, she tried the brisket as did I. Her standards are set high! I&amp;rsquo;m pretty confident about how this first Texas brisket will turn out though so I&amp;rsquo;m not worried ðŸ˜‰
I picked up a 15.65 lbs brisket, $2.98 per pound from Sam&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Well, we&amp;rsquo;re still unpacking things, but we&amp;rsquo;ve been here for a bit. One of the things I was most excited to have arrive is the smoker - not gonna lie, that was a top priority. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to having some smoked Salmon again, and Sarah has mentioned it a couple times too.
There&amp;rsquo;s a Sam&amp;rsquo;s Club more convenient these days, so I picked up some salmon there. They had Sockeye for about $12 a pound, and &amp;ldquo;Atlantic&amp;rdquo; for about $9.</description>

      <description>Smoked salmon is one of my favorite foods. A luxury, truly. But, it&amp;rsquo;s much more reasonable when you can smoke it yourself. Salmon prices are at $8.99 a pound at Costco right now, which is a couple bucks more than I&amp;rsquo;m used to. Still worth it.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the same recipe I always use, with a bit over 5 lbs of salmon. This salmon was packed a couple days ago, unusually.</description>

      <title>Brisket and Salmon Again</title>

      <description>I ran out of brisket too quickly last time&amp;hellip; It makes a fantastic sandwich with Philly Cream Cheese (strangely enough). Then I eat a bunch of salmon on bagels, with Philly Cream Cheese&amp;hellip; The discovery that it&amp;rsquo;s the right cheese for both sandwiches has made shopping easier.
The brisket is 15.5 lbs, $2.99 per pound. Salmon is 6 lbs, didn&amp;rsquo;t get the price before tossing the package. We have to move in July and I hope I can keep up this hobby at the next stop in life.</description>

      <title>Ribs and Salmon</title>

      <description>Time to try some ribs!Â I&amp;rsquo;ll use this recipe with the Memphis Dust dry rub I used on the pork butts.Â Also - we&amp;rsquo;re out of Salmon.Â I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a double batch of the usual.Â I&amp;rsquo;ll just do 6 pounds for four hours, then do 6 more for 4 more hours.

I bought what I thought were 3 racks of ribs - 3 large vacuum-packed things of ribs from Costco.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a Saturday and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a ton of stuff to do, and we&amp;rsquo;re out of Salmon!Â A terrible problem with one clear solution.Â It&amp;rsquo;s time to smoke more meat.Â We&amp;rsquo;ve eaten almost all of the chicken and pork now, so I can feel good doing another brisket.
Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ve been excited for the last two weeks to do another brisket.Â Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ve been excited since the last time I did one, but in the last two weeks the excitement has come to a head.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s today&amp;rsquo;s recipe!Â Based on a couple things:
 1. The recipe my mom sent me called Amway Grand Plaza Grilled Chicken Midwest - in my Google Docs Recipes folder 2. [https://ohsweetbasil.com/how-to-smoke-chicken/](https://ohsweetbasil.com/how-to-smoke-chicken/)  Other great info and ideas at these links - at some point I&amp;rsquo;d like to try the brine/minimal method:
 1. [http://www.smokegrillbbq.com/brine-smoked-chicken-recipe.html](http://www.smokegrillbbq.com/brine-smoked-chicken-recipe.html) 2. [https://www.traegergrills.com/recipes/poultry/whole-smoked-chicken](https://www.traegergrills.com/recipes/poultry/whole-smoked-chicken)  Anyway - here&amp;rsquo;s the plan today.Â Make a marinade of the ingredients below, divide this among four butterflied (spatchcocked?</description>

      <title>Third Smoking - Pork Butts and Salmon</title>

      <description>I began prep on Sunday night with 16 lbs of pork butt split into three parts, and 5.5 pounds of salmon. I used the typical salmon recipe, this time I did one quart of brine and still separated things into 4 bags. I used this pulled pork recipe, and this dry rub recipe per Ben&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. The pulled pork recipe looked to be a reasonable beginner&amp;rsquo;s complexity, too&amp;hellip; I considered this pork butt set to be just three of the one used in the recipe, so I had 1 cup of dry rub that I used on the three.</description>

      <title>Second Smoking - Brisket and Salmon</title>

      <description>Some notes from the second time I busted-out the smoker - I made brisket and salmon.
The brisket recipe is based on https://heygrillhey.com/recipe/texas-style-smoked-beef-brisket/, and the salmon recipe is the one I normally make.
I used a 16.5 lbs brisket from Costco, $2.99 per pound.Â Turned on the smoker to 225, added hickory wood chips.Â Trimmed 1-2 lbs fat off, took just over half an hour to trim.Â Sliced it in half so it would fit in the smoker.</description>

      <title>First Smoking - Salmon</title>

      <description>Some notes from the first time I used the smoker - I made smoked salmon.Â The result was awesome - I&amp;rsquo;ve made it a couple times since then, and am just dropping this here for future note.
Recipe: https://honest-food.net/how-to-smoke-salmon-recipe/
I really just followed the instructions.Â I used Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, as he recommends - which, BTW, is probably going to become my goto salt.Â I used Costco salmon without the skin on - it worked perfectly.</description>
