      <description>META: Part 1 describes the problem I&amp;rsquo;m trying to solve here.
I need a way to monitor water flow through my water filter over several days, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sit and watch it.
So - I took a Raspberry Pi I&amp;rsquo;ve got and a little Python and hacked a solution together. The basic idea was that I&amp;rsquo;d position a plastic cup below the output stream of the waste water, I&amp;rsquo;d put two wires into the cup, I&amp;rsquo;d put a voltage on one wire and attempt to see the voltage on the other.</description>

      <description>META: This first part is about the problem that caused me to build the solution. Part 2 is about the solution.
My new place has an awesome feature that was disabled when I moved in - a reverse osmosis water filter! It&amp;rsquo;s not a whole-house hookup, it&amp;rsquo;s just for the refrigerator and a dedicated tap on the sink. We definitely wanted to use this thing! At first, I just turned it on and it seemed to work fine.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never built anything with an LCD on it before, but it seems like it&amp;rsquo;d be useful. Here&amp;rsquo;s some good info on creating an project with an LCD and an Arduino:
http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal
It&amp;rsquo;s a library of functions that make it very easy to work with the LCD controller. The controller has to be compatible with the HD44780 controller&amp;rsquo;s instruction set, but that&amp;rsquo;s basically an industry standard. Mouser has a selection of 20x4 character displays:</description>
