      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamal Jabbour and Dr. Erich Devendorf &lt;a href=&#34;https://cyberdefensereview.army.mil/Portals/6/Documents/CDR%20Journal%20Articles/Cyber%20Threat%20Characterization_Jabbour_Devendorf.pdf?ver=2018-07-31-093724-720&#34;&gt;have characterized the cyber threat the DoD faces&lt;/a&gt;.  They describe threats as having these ten characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly educated on the science of information assurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctrinally trained on the art of cyber warfare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adequately resourced in talent, time, and treasure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly briefed on target missions and systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematically specialized in architectural properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superiorly skilled in byzantine failure analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intricately involved in protocol specification and analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critically embedded in the supply chain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategically postured in command and control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conveniently situated for access and persistence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper uses these points to demonstrate how an adversary thinks about attacking our systems.  However, I see a lot of ways in which these should coerce the DoD to make serious changes in how we build and maintain our cyber professional workforce.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on SWAP</title>

      <description>I just finished reading the SWAP study. The thrilling congressionally-mandated &amp;ldquo;Software Acquisition and Practices&amp;rdquo; study conducted by the Defense Innovation Board. 292 pages of discussion about the US government&amp;rsquo;s software acquisition practices.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually quite a bit funnier than you&amp;rsquo;d expect. Admittedly, it helps to be in on the jokes.
These are the same folks that brought us: Detecting Agile BS. A document which is unexpectedly funny, for a government report, and accurate.</description>

      <title>The Cyber Sim</title>

      <description>This is a fictional imagining of what could be.
Dear Journal,
I took a refreshing break from my staff job today to keep up my &amp;ldquo;mission qualification&amp;rdquo;, and it really re-centered me. Sim time is something only pilots used to talk about, but the new &amp;ldquo;cyber sim&amp;rdquo; concept has brought that idea into the info ops world. Stupid name, great concept.
I took my laptop out to the local library and sat in a back room one of the squadrons borrows regularly.</description>

      <title>Star Trek Had it Right </title>

      <description>Star Trek had it right. They were a bunch of peace loving (except for Worf) scientists roaming the universe in a war ship. They always kept their cool when someone faced them down, but if they needed to Jean Luc had no problem blasting the enemy out of the sky.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Animal Farm recently, and it has impressed upon me the need to maintain arms and a force capable of using them no matter how peaceful society gets.</description>
