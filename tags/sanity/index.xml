      <description>A friend and coworker told me about intermittent fasting a few years ago. She was doing it as part of a weight loss competition at work&amp;hellip; She was one of those folks that says they want to lose weight, but - I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure why they actually need to? My wife does that too - doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to lose weight but makes plans to do-so anyway.
Anyway - this woman was doing intermittent fasting by not eating for most of the day.</description>
