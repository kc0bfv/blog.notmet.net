      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve got some of Sarah&amp;rsquo;s best friends in town, and some of their family is coming over Sunday, so I&amp;rsquo;m busting out the smoker to feed everybody. Time for some pulled pork!
2030, Friday: salted the 15 lbs butt with 2.5 Tbsp salt. It&amp;rsquo;s in the fridge now until Saturday night, when I&amp;rsquo;ll put 1 cup rub on and start it smoking at 225℉.
2215, Saturday: put the butt on the smoker at 225℉, after putting the rub on.</description>

      <description>Alright! Time to BBQ for some other people. We&amp;rsquo;re throwing a baby shower for some friends of ours, and one of the I&amp;rsquo;m going to bust out the pork butt recipe I used last time, and do it the same.
I got a 15 lbs butt from Costco again - it looks beautiful. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of dry rub from last time leftover in the cabinet.
24 Feb 2018, 1420: Began trimming the pork (took out chunks, left layers of fat about 1/8&amp;rdquo; thick - leaving a little more fat than last time), and then salting it.</description>

      <description>I began prep on Sunday night with 16 lbs of pork butt split into three parts, and 5.5 pounds of salmon. I used the typical salmon recipe, this time I did one quart of brine and still separated things into 4 bags. I used this pulled pork recipe, and this dry rub recipe per Ben&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. The pulled pork recipe looked to be a reasonable beginner&amp;rsquo;s complexity, too&amp;hellip; I considered this pork butt set to be just three of the one used in the recipe, so I had 1 cup of dry rub that I used on the three.</description>
