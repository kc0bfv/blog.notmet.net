      <description>I recently converted this blog over from a WordPress installation to use static pages generated by Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Hugo for my other recent web creations and I&amp;rsquo;ve been very impressed. The templating system is very nice, the page generation is lightning fast, and I&amp;rsquo;m always able to find something near what I need in the themes.
One WordPress feature I liked was the listing of articles by year and month&amp;hellip; My blog had a little timeline on the side with each year and month listed, annotated with the number of postings I made during each.</description>

      <title>Syntax Errors</title>

      <description>Syntax Errors in Python are great. Here&amp;rsquo;s one:
 File &amp;quot;asdf.py&amp;quot;, line 2 print(&amp;quot;Result is: {}&amp;quot;.format(result)) ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax result = ((5 * 10) + 15 print(&amp;#34;Result is: {}&amp;#34;.format(result)) Two lines of code&amp;hellip; Syntax error on the print line, evidently. But where? That line looks so simple and correct! And pointing directly at the t?
Well - it&amp;rsquo;s not really on the print line. Folks who have done any amount of programming will look at the preceeding line fairly quickly and notice the missing parenthesis.</description>

      <description>META: Part 1 describes the problem I&amp;rsquo;m trying to solve here.
I need a way to monitor water flow through my water filter over several days, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sit and watch it.
So - I took a Raspberry Pi I&amp;rsquo;ve got and a little Python and hacked a solution together. The basic idea was that I&amp;rsquo;d position a plastic cup below the output stream of the waste water, I&amp;rsquo;d put two wires into the cup, I&amp;rsquo;d put a voltage on one wire and attempt to see the voltage on the other.</description>
