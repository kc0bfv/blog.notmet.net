      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well - the world is on lockdown - it&amp;rsquo;s COVID-19 time.  We don&amp;rsquo;t have any toilet paper at the store, but there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of meat.  Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why there&amp;rsquo;s such a disparity - I guess folks are stocking up on other things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

         alt=&#34;The shelves at Broulim&amp;#39;s - a few bags of all purpose flour remain, and a ton of large 25 lb bags remain on the bottom shelf.&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Not much left&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Idaho Pork Butt</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve smoked a couple things here in Idaho, and learned that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter where you&amp;rsquo;re making the meat, as long as you have a good starting point. Costco, in MD, and Sam&amp;rsquo;s Club here, have both provided excellent canvases on which to add smoke. Here in Idaho, though, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done pulled pork yet. Sam&amp;rsquo;s had a 10.8 lbs&amp;rsquo;er, $1.98 per pound.
Well, it&amp;rsquo;s time. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a baby coming any day now, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to have a ton of extra meat in the freezer.</description>

      <description>Alright! It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas! I meant to do this a week ago, but the turkey was still frozen, so we&amp;rsquo;re doing it today. If it turns out terrible we&amp;rsquo;ll be eating Chinese for dinner.
I got a pre-brined 12 lbs turkey for less than $1 per pound, put olive oil on the skin, then sprinkled on the rub I use on pork butt because it&amp;rsquo;s similar to what this person recommends anyway.</description>

      <description>Well, we&amp;rsquo;re still unpacking things, but we&amp;rsquo;ve been here for a bit. One of the things I was most excited to have arrive is the smoker - not gonna lie, that was a top priority. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to having some smoked Salmon again, and Sarah has mentioned it a couple times too.
There&amp;rsquo;s a Sam&amp;rsquo;s Club more convenient these days, so I picked up some salmon there. They had Sockeye for about $12 a pound, and &amp;ldquo;Atlantic&amp;rdquo; for about $9.</description>

      <description>2120: pre-ferment done, by weight, except 2 Tbsp starter (40g).
For the jerky marinade, I followed the original foodie recipe but skipped the brown sugar (we were out), and subbed coconut aminos for soy sauce, left out liquid smoke, used regular paprika, and added slightly more cayenne then called for. I sliced the 2.5 lbs of top round with the grain mostly.
9:50: meat is in marinade.
0815, next day: I added the remainder of an old packet of regular yeast to the sourdough, about 5g.</description>

      <description>This is lamb weekend. Some folks call it Easter weekend. I&amp;rsquo;m doing two legs of lamb - right leg and left leg. Both are about 4.7 lbs, $5.99 per pound. Today, Saturday, I&amp;rsquo;m going to smoke one based on this recipe, and tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m going to Sous Vide one based on the same recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past. Sarah likes meat more well-done than I do, and with lamb I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that much, so my target is medium-well.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve got some of Sarah&amp;rsquo;s best friends in town, and some of their family is coming over Sunday, so I&amp;rsquo;m busting out the smoker to feed everybody. Time for some pulled pork!
2030, Friday: salted the 15 lbs butt with 2.5 Tbsp salt. It&amp;rsquo;s in the fridge now until Saturday night, when I&amp;rsquo;ll put 1 cup rub on and start it smoking at 225℉.
2215, Saturday: put the butt on the smoker at 225℉, after putting the rub on.</description>

      <description>One of my best buddies got us some steaks for our wedding, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to smoke a couple of them! Four of the steaks are half pound fillet mignons, so I&amp;rsquo;m smoking two. I&amp;rsquo;m wrapping two slices of applewood bacon around each steak, putting 1/4 tsp salt on each, and smoking them at 225℉. I&amp;rsquo;ll use the thermometers, smoking them to 130℉, then searing top and bottom on cast iron.</description>

      <description>Alright, time for more beef jerky. This time I found top round roast for $3.99 per pound. I&amp;rsquo;m using the same recipe as last time, but it&amp;rsquo;s 3.5 lbs so I multiplied the marinade by about 1.5. I sliced the meat more along the grain than last time, and also slightly thicker.
1530: Meat is in the marinade.
1020 Sunday: Meat is on the smoker, 175℉, vents half open this time cause why not, that&amp;rsquo;s what I normally do.</description>

      <description>Smoked salmon is one of my favorite foods. A luxury, truly. But, it&amp;rsquo;s much more reasonable when you can smoke it yourself. Salmon prices are at $8.99 a pound at Costco right now, which is a couple bucks more than I&amp;rsquo;m used to. Still worth it.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the same recipe I always use, with a bit over 5 lbs of salmon. This salmon was packed a couple days ago, unusually.</description>

      <description>My brother-in-law gave me a taste of some of his homemade beef jerky a couple weekends ago, and it was fantastic! Apparently it was also easy to make. Easy, delicious, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try it! He used a dehydrator, but I plan to use a smoker to keep my wife&amp;rsquo;s dehydrator from getting strong flavors stuck in it.

      <description>I ran out of brisket too quickly last time&amp;hellip; It makes a fantastic sandwich with Philly Cream Cheese (strangely enough). Then I eat a bunch of salmon on bagels, with Philly Cream Cheese&amp;hellip; The discovery that it&amp;rsquo;s the right cheese for both sandwiches has made shopping easier.
The brisket is 15.5 lbs, $2.99 per pound. Salmon is 6 lbs, didn&amp;rsquo;t get the price before tossing the package. We have to move in July and I hope I can keep up this hobby at the next stop in life.</description>

17 lbs brisket, $61, 6 lbs salmon $9 per pound. Using the same recipe as usual.

      <description>Well, there&amp;rsquo;s the possibility that the brisket I did last weekend won&amp;rsquo;t be enough meat&amp;hellip; And there&amp;rsquo;s the fact that I can get another one done in time&amp;hellip; So I&amp;rsquo;m making another brisket! We&amp;rsquo;ll just try for a repeat performance&amp;hellip;
14.1 lbs of brisket at $3.99 a pound&amp;hellip;
1045, 21 Jul: Brisket went on, fat cap up, 225℉. I should check the temperature after 8 hours, at 0645.
0900, 22 Jul: The flat passed 166℉ a couple hours ago, but the point was only at 162℉.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to make the brisket for our Maryland wedding party! I&amp;rsquo;m pumped. Goals this time - turn up the temperature to 250℉ earlier, or put it in the oven for a long time. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go more than 24 hours, I can&amp;rsquo;t go for nearly that long&amp;hellip; Cut off less fat than last time. Keep the fat cap on top&amp;hellip;
The slab of meat I got was a full brisket, point and flat, 14.</description>

      <description>Time to try some ribs! I&amp;rsquo;ll use this recipe with the Memphis Dust dry rub I used on the pork butts. Also - we&amp;rsquo;re out of Salmon. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a double batch of the usual. I&amp;rsquo;ll just do 6 pounds for four hours, then do 6 more for 4 more hours.

I bought what I thought were 3 racks of ribs - 3 large vacuum-packed things of ribs from Costco.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a Saturday and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a ton of stuff to do, and we&amp;rsquo;re out of Salmon! A terrible problem with one clear solution. It&amp;rsquo;s time to smoke more meat. We&amp;rsquo;ve eaten almost all of the chicken and pork now, so I can feel good doing another brisket.
Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ve been excited for the last two weeks to do another brisket. Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ve been excited since the last time I did one, but in the last two weeks the excitement has come to a head.</description>

I got a 15 lbs butt from Costco again - it looks beautiful. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of dry rub from last time leftover in the cabinet.
24 Feb 2018, 1420: Began trimming the pork (took out chunks, left layers of fat about 1/8&amp;rdquo; thick - leaving a little more fat than last time), and then salting it.</description>

      <description>I began prep on Sunday night with 16 lbs of pork butt split into three parts, and 5.5 pounds of salmon. I used the typical salmon recipe, this time I did one quart of brine and still separated things into 4 bags. I used this pulled pork recipe, and this dry rub recipe per Ben&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. The pulled pork recipe looked to be a reasonable beginner&amp;rsquo;s complexity, too&amp;hellip; I considered this pork butt set to be just three of the one used in the recipe, so I had 1 cup of dry rub that I used on the three.</description>

      <description>Some notes from the second time I busted-out the smoker - I made brisket and salmon.
The brisket recipe is based on https://heygrillhey.com/recipe/texas-style-smoked-beef-brisket/, and the salmon recipe is the one I normally make.
I used a 16.5 lbs brisket from Costco, $2.99 per pound. Turned on the smoker to 225, added hickory wood chips. Trimmed 1-2 lbs fat off, took just over half an hour to trim. Sliced it in half so it would fit in the smoker.</description>

I really just followed the instructions. I used Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, as he recommends - which, BTW, is probably going to become my goto salt. I used Costco salmon without the skin on - it worked perfectly.</description>
