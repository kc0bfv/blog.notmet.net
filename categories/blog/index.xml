      <title>Scope: Not Just Mouthwash</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m teaching a Python class which acts as an introduction to programming, for most of the students there. This is an awesome experience - for me personally because I enjoy this, and for my resume. I hope to do this full-time someday, but today I&amp;rsquo;ve just got 3 sections of the same class.
We&amp;rsquo;re doing a lot of cool things that I should write about some other time - one of them is using a free, open source textbook called, Runestone - How to Think Like a Computer Scientist.</description>

      <description>One feature I lost moving from Wordpress to Hugo for this blog was the ability to write a blog post from anywhere. I really liked being able to do that&amp;hellip; I could be riding in the car, or smoking brisket at 2 AM, or on vacation without a computer, and just login and write something.
I wanted that back - a posting solution from my cellphone.
The reason I lost that ability is because the simplest update process for Hugo is:</description>

      <title>First Do No Limiting</title>

      <description>I recently saw a quote from an old boss of mine. The full paragraph is below, placing it in context, but the part that seems notable (pointed out by a friend of mine) is the, &amp;ldquo;it is important for a leader to &amp;hellip; not limit the potential of those they serve.&amp;rdquo;
 The command sets the tone/culture – which is difficult to quantify. I believe the best culture allows decision capability to those “closest to the fight,” while still maintaining a sense of responsibility should a problem arise.</description>

      <description>This morning I finished Planet Money&amp;rsquo;s Episode 963: 13,000 Economists. 1 Question.. These fine folks make one of my favorite podcasts - each week is a different look at something weird from a weird perspective. It sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s very market/economy focused, but it&amp;rsquo;s really focused on everything economics. In the past decades economics has branched out to look at nearly every field of human endeavor with a mathematical eye. It&amp;rsquo;s not always very successful, but the economist perspective does make me look at things differently.</description>

      <title>A January Experiment: Intermittent Fasting</title>

      <description>A friend and coworker told me about intermittent fasting a few years ago. She was doing it as part of a weight loss competition at work&amp;hellip; She was one of those folks that says they want to lose weight, but - I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure why they actually need to? My wife does that too - doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to lose weight but makes plans to do-so anyway.
Anyway - this woman was doing intermittent fasting by not eating for most of the day.</description>

      <description>I recently converted this blog over from a WordPress installation to use static pages generated by Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Hugo for my other recent web creations and I&amp;rsquo;ve been very impressed. The templating system is very nice, the page generation is lightning fast, and I&amp;rsquo;m always able to find something near what I need in the themes.
One WordPress feature I liked was the listing of articles by year and month&amp;hellip; My blog had a little timeline on the side with each year and month listed, annotated with the number of postings I made during each.</description>

      <title>Syntax Errors</title>

      <description>Syntax Errors in Python are great. Here&amp;rsquo;s one:
 File &amp;quot;asdf.py&amp;quot;, line 2 print(&amp;quot;Result is: {}&amp;quot;.format(result)) ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax result = ((5 * 10) + 15 print(&amp;#34;Result is: {}&amp;#34;.format(result)) Two lines of code&amp;hellip; Syntax error on the print line, evidently. But where? That line looks so simple and correct! And pointing directly at the t?
Well - it&amp;rsquo;s not really on the print line. Folks who have done any amount of programming will look at the preceeding line fairly quickly and notice the missing parenthesis.</description>

      <description>I just finished reading the SWAP study. The thrilling congressionally-mandated &amp;ldquo;Software Acquisition and Practices&amp;rdquo; study conducted by the Defense Innovation Board. 292 pages of discussion about the US government&amp;rsquo;s software acquisition practices.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually quite a bit funnier than you&amp;rsquo;d expect. Admittedly, it helps to be in on the jokes.
These are the same folks that brought us: Detecting Agile BS. A document which is unexpectedly funny, for a government report, and accurate.</description>

      <description>I was thinking this morning about how I might manage an Air Force unit that provides networked server management services. For some reason. I realized that, while I know a bit about some of the technology used to provide cloud services, and manage a server farm - or at least what’s used by some cloud providers - I don’t know much about how they organize their business. I started to wonder if someone from Rackspace, or AWS, or DigitalOcean had written a book about their management practices, or company organization.</description>

      <description>CybatiWorks is an educational and research tool for learning about Industrial Control System cyber components. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it much, but it looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll simulate a PLC controlling a process, and it&amp;rsquo;ll do it on a Raspberry PI, GPIO-connected hardware, and a controlling HMI (Human-Machine Interface) desktop. You can buy the hardware pre-setup, then use it in a course.
The person who runs the company is Matthew Luallen, and he&amp;rsquo;s quite responsive over email.</description>

      <description>I’ve done some small research about blockchain recently, and just want to put my thoughts down on paperblog so I can stop thinking them. Most of this is rehashing information I’ve read, but the “signed code verification” piece towards the end is an idea of mine that I’ve not read about elsewhere.
 Blockchain is a hot term these days. It&amp;rsquo;s a popular management buzzword, and as such it can get thrown about as a cure for just about all that ails you.</description>

      <description>Idaho National Labs has a program right now called “CO-STAR”. Their researchers do great work, but as with any research group they are constantly advocating for funding, and researchers are constantly advocating among themselves for time.
Everybody spends time advocating for something. “Pitching” something. You want your boss to consider a smarter way of working, one that you’ve come up with? You pitch it to her. You want someone to use an open-source project you’ve created?</description>

      <description>A recent episode of the Freakonomics podcast covered meetings. Two or more people gathering to accomplish the business of business, as they defined it. It gave me some things I hope I remember the next time I’m organizing a recurring staff meeting…
 Organize an agenda around questions-to-answer Hold smaller meetings Keep track and time  Meetings need agendas, just about every book I’ve read which touches on meetings agrees on this point.</description>

      <description>To improve innovation on a team, consider building a team differently based on the problem you’re facing. There are many ways of categorizing a problem your team must solve, but one is along the axis of well-definedness.
Well-defined problems – here, you know what you’re trying to solve, you know what end-state your audience will find acceptable, maybe you’ve seen similar problems solved elsewhere or you even know some current acceptable solutions.</description>

 Build on My Strengths and on My Peoples’ Strengths
   Know your peoples’ strengths and put those strengths to work. Build teams with a diversity of strengths.</description>

      <description>When I was flight commander, supervising a group of fellow nerds with nerd jobs, I spent almost all of my time on the administrative requirements. They needed me to do the boss stuff - that was my official position!
I really wanted to do the nerd stuff though. It&amp;rsquo;s more fun, it&amp;rsquo;s my strength, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got more experience with it&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that as the boss I had input into many nerdy problems, and having that was rewarding.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Perception is reality&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this quote numerous times. The falsehood evident in those words should be obvious, but these days perhaps it is not. Reality is reality, perception is perception.
Often reality and perception overlap heavily - but we don&amp;rsquo;t notice those times when our perceptions are correct. Our brains think that&amp;rsquo;s the default. There&amp;rsquo;s also almost always some amount of perception that doesn&amp;rsquo;t overlap reality - when our brain is jumping to conclusions and we are misled.</description>

      <description>One of the things every leadership course includes is some discussion of personality types. Usually everyone has to take or retake a personality test for the Myers-Briggs system. You usually go around the room at some point and talk about, or show by example, the effects of each piece of the type.
Then, at some point, they recommend building teams with a diversity of personality.
But who actually ends up doing that?</description>

Dear Journal,
I took a refreshing break from my staff job today to keep up my &amp;ldquo;mission qualification&amp;rdquo;, and it really re-centered me. Sim time is something only pilots used to talk about, but the new &amp;ldquo;cyber sim&amp;rdquo; concept has brought that idea into the info ops world. Stupid name, great concept.
I took my laptop out to the local library and sat in a back room one of the squadrons borrows regularly.</description>

      <description>The broken windows theory of policing suggests that when police target small crimes like &amp;ldquo;vandalism, public drinking, and fare evasion,&amp;quot; and reduce visible signs of &amp;ldquo;crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder&amp;rdquo; they reduce the likelihood of further and worse crime.
This can certainly be taken too far, as in &amp;ldquo;stop-and-frisk&amp;rdquo; policies, if those are examples of broken windows policing, as some suggest.
When applied to a team you&amp;rsquo;re leading, broken windows policing looks like: making sure uniforms are still sharp and worn properly, office common spaces are kept tidy, individuals are shown respect in each interaction, promises are kept, report and presentation standards are being met, and people generally meet the requirements and standards of each of their duties.</description>

      <description>Commanders of operational units maintain their flying qualification. Most units in the Air Force aren&amp;rsquo;t flying units, but all have some mission they&amp;rsquo;re responsible for.
 Remain Qualified on your Mission System
   Once a quarter I should spend a day making sure I&amp;rsquo;m up to speed on the mission my folks are doing, and if possible I should get some practice actually doing it. At the least I should sit alongside folks as they execute the mission.</description>

      <description>A couple tips about getting an Android phone working again when you&amp;rsquo;re on the road are down below, along with tips about TOTP codes when your phone dies. I set those apart. But first, the background.
Recently, my Google Pixel stopped working for phone calls. That&amp;rsquo;s a big deal when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to move across the country. Not to mention the fact that failing to work for phone calls is an existential crisis for a cell phone.</description>

      <description>How do we assess an individual&amp;rsquo;s fluency with computers? We&amp;rsquo;re gonna go a little deeper than ability to use Microsoft Word&amp;hellip;
There&amp;rsquo;s a point, in knowledge and skill in the field of computer science, when programming languages mostly start to look and feel similar. &amp;ldquo;Learning a new language&amp;rdquo; is more like learning the peculiarities of a dialect of some language you already speak, than switching from English to Russian. When laypeople ask if you know a certain programming language, one which you do not already know, it occurs to you that answering in the negative would not be entirely correct.</description>

      <description>I recently read this cautionary tale about shell scripts. https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/writing-secure-shell-scripts
It&amp;rsquo;s cautionary in two ways: it is intended to cause shell programmers caution, and I caution against you taking the article too seriously.
One of the biggest threats to the shell in memory was the Shellshock vulnerability. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t typically a direct threat to shell scripts, but one caused by a bug in a shell, and by other programs exposing parts of the shell to external input, often in unexpected and unlikely places.</description>

 The Hitchcock on the truck.
  Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be the outline of Alfred Hitchcock. It looks a lot like Harambe though&amp;hellip;

If you want to make one, check out the Thingiverse thing here. Download all files, open the zip up, and under &amp;ldquo;files&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll find an &amp;ldquo;stl&amp;rdquo; file. Hop on over to https://www.3dhubs.com/, click &amp;ldquo;start manufacturing&amp;rdquo;, and upload that &amp;ldquo;stl&amp;rdquo; file.</description>

      <title>Confidentiality and Integrity vs Availability</title>

      <description>In computer security, there are three main axes for consideration - confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). These are commonly thought of as things you desire out of a secure system. You want your communications to only be available to the intended agents, you want them to remain unchanged except when you intend them to change, and you want them to be available when you need them. Preferably, you want your communications to have all of those properties.</description>

      <description>It looks like https://github.com/nixawk/labs/issues/19 is being exploited like crazy right now. I was getting hits trying to exploit it every 4 hours or so, then the rate sped up for a time. Each hit was trying to download drupal.php from http://51.254.219.134.
Somebody has nulled out that file now, so infection rate will probably drop.</description>

      <description>Sarah and I did a big trip of the UK and Ireland in October 2017. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a series of blog posts about these, intended to be informative to the person planning a similar trip. The posts are listed in order, below.

      <description>Sarah and I are in line to get on our Norwegian Air flight home. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s time to wrap these posts up.
Some things to mention.
There&amp;rsquo;s lots of free WiFi. Still, having data access over the air is amazing. Google Project Fi gave me data access everywhere for the same price I pay at home. Phone calls are a bit expensive, but who makes those? WiFi calling is normal and texts are free.</description>

      <description>We took some side trips from Dublin - one to Cork/Blarney castle/Midleton, and one to the Cliffs of Moher with a few extra stops in there&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to take the train from Dublin to Cork, be and from there you take the Cork bus to Blarney castle and Midleton (Jameson&amp;rsquo;s major distillery). The train leaves from Dublin Heuston station (pronounced like the Houston in Texas), and takes a couple hours.</description>

      <description>Watch Yourself at Dublin Airport
  Land at Dublin airport, take a trip through passport control, buy a Leap card at the tourist desk inside, put €20 on it, step outside to the bus stop, hop on the Airlink 757 bus, get a tour of downtown from the top of a double decker bus, step off 30 minutes later in downtown Dublin.
The EU really has passport control figured out.</description>

      <description>I pushed the accelerator of the Peugeot 3008 to the floor, as I slammed it from fifth into third to accelerate up the hill and around the corner while the rock wall on the passenger side caused the proximity sensor to light and the lorry passed within inches on the driver&amp;rsquo;s side. Lock one, lock two, Loch Lomond on the right and an ancient wall on the left.

      <description>On the morning of 7 Oct Sarah and I headed to the Stansted airport to fly to Glasgow. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to get to the airport, there&amp;rsquo;s a train out of the Liverpool Street station that takes you right there. I got tickets in advance, and they&amp;rsquo;ll take them right from your phone screen. We cashed in the remaining funds on our Oyster cards before heading out - the normal Oyster machines at the station will give your remaining money back.</description>

      <description>Sarah on the Tower Bridge&amp;rsquo;s Glass Floor
  One thing I questioned before we got here was the wisdom of using this thing called The London Pass. It&amp;rsquo;s a card you purchase for 1, 2, or 3 days of entry into a ton of attractions. On our first partial day here I realized it was probably a good deal for us, in part just so that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to constantly wonder if any one place&amp;rsquo;s entry price was really worth it.</description>

      <description>META: Part 1 describes the problem I&amp;rsquo;m trying to solve here.
I need a way to monitor water flow through my water filter over several days, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sit and watch it.
So - I took a Raspberry Pi I&amp;rsquo;ve got and a little Python and hacked a solution together. The basic idea was that I&amp;rsquo;d position a plastic cup below the output stream of the waste water, I&amp;rsquo;d put two wires into the cup, I&amp;rsquo;d put a voltage on one wire and attempt to see the voltage on the other.</description>

      <description>META: This first part is about the problem that caused me to build the solution. Part 2 is about the solution.
My new place has an awesome feature that was disabled when I moved in - a reverse osmosis water filter! It&amp;rsquo;s not a whole-house hookup, it&amp;rsquo;s just for the refrigerator and a dedicated tap on the sink. We definitely wanted to use this thing! At first, I just turned it on and it seemed to work fine.</description>

I feel a little crazy every time I connect. But I usually console myself that I&amp;rsquo;m not a target, I can make sure important connections are encrypted, and I can just avoid doing some things while on public wifi.
A VPN though, that could make things much easier!</description>

      <description>This is one of those Saturdays where I&amp;rsquo;m finding it hard to focus on what I want to focus on. Ok, so that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty regular problem for me on Saturday. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to focus on programming for this volunteer activity I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be leading in September. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to build some software for the event, and make some decisions, and wrap it all up at some point. It&amp;rsquo;s not too far from being done, and I guess this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had to just sit and think a bit this week, so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m not too concerned about being unproductive, and I&amp;rsquo;m just letting my mind wander.</description>

      <description>This article proposes a pretty crazy sounding idea - remove the Van Allen Belts.
Simplified Explanatory Summary: The Van Allen Belts are a natural phenomenon, electrons and protons flying around the Earth at high speed. Electrical current is essentially electrons moving around, so when astronauts or satellites pass through these regions the effect is shocking. Passing through the proton regions is even worse because they&amp;rsquo;re comparatively mass-ive. Electrons and protons are normally flying around in space, but these ones are trapped by Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field.</description>

      <description>This article in The Economist summarizes most of the issues relevant to this whole Edward Snowden debacle. Their attitude is that the amount of secret surveillance going on in the US, as suggested by the current news cycle, makes democracy difficult. It&amp;rsquo;s worth a skim just to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not missing some chunk of the debate and recent history. The Economist is about as much a disinterested third party as I can think of.</description>

      <description>This article in the Atlantic struck a chord with me. It&amp;rsquo;s about how, in life, searching for meaning can leave people more satisfied than searching for happiness.
 As [Viktor Frankl] saw in the [concentration] camps, those who found meaning even in the most horrendous circumstances were far more resilient to suffering than those who did not. &amp;ldquo;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing&amp;rdquo;.
 Meaning, more than happiness, is long-term.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Heh, this music&amp;hellip; right?&amp;rdquo; Surely anybody would agree this was a crazy mix.
&amp;ldquo;I kinda like it&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; she said.
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s alright&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; This reply doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any thought. I put my foot in my mouth so often, this reply is just a reflex at this point.</description>

      <title>Bash Dictionary - Terrible Hack of the Day</title>

      <guid>https://blog.notmet.net/2012/12/bash-dictionary-terrible-hack-of-the-day/</guid>
      <description>So, I just had a reason to implement something like a dictionary in Bash. Of course, I could try to determine if such a feature exists already (it does in Bash 4, alas the default on OS X seems to be 3.2), but why not just try to hack something together?
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I got initially:
OFFSETDICTkeyUno=5 OFFSETDICTkeyDos=4 OFFSETDICTkeyTres=17 OFFSETDICTkeyQuatro=21 keyToLookup=&amp;quot;keyQuatro&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;$(eval echo &#39;$OFFSETDICT&#39;${keyToLookup})&amp;quot; echo $value &amp;gt; 21 So, that&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous.</description>

      <description>The back of a truck is an appropriate place to watch a meteor shower. I had driven out onto a back road in Yellow Springs, Ohio, to watch the meteors fall, and I was not disappointed. Orion knew where most of them were coming from - he was calling the shots.
I had barely pulled off the two-lane dirt road and onto some tire tracks in the grass. A run-down barbed wire fence with old knotty posts ran alongside the road, and was only a few feet from the truck.</description>

 It was just a song, but one that Starbucks seemed to have on a tight loop. Every time I&amp;rsquo;d walk into one of the four Starbucks I had on rotation I&amp;rsquo;d hear the song - I&amp;rsquo;d hear it twenty times.
The first few times I heard that old crooner belting out the difficult-to-understand lyrics, I enjoyed myself.</description>

      <description>For some reason November is now Mustache November. Now we&amp;rsquo;ve got two months out of the year where we have to grow mustaches? I don&amp;rsquo;t get it. This is supposed to be some statement about masculinity or something? Whatever. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to grow a mustache, ride a motorcycle, or drink whiskey, to be a man (although admittedly all those things are awesome).
Men should know how to stop a toilet that&amp;rsquo;s overflowing, and we should know how to change a tire.</description>

      <description>Google Scholar just added a citations feature which, among other things, lets you get a BibTeX formatted citation. This is so handy, and I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered for a while why they didn&amp;rsquo;t have that feature in there. Often you can go to the IEEE page or whatever to get the citation, but some journals make you login (IEEE, why do you do that?) and anyway this makes one less click.
  To copy a formatted citation, click on the “Cite” link below a search result and select from the available citation styles (currently MLA, APA, or Chicago) [&amp;hellip;] You can also use one of the import links to import the citation into BibTeX or another bibliography manager.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of Python lately, and there are some things I love about it, some things I&amp;rsquo;m uncomfortable with, but nothing I hate. The super() builtin function makes life a lot easier when you&amp;rsquo;re using Python for object oriented code and have some inheritance going on. This blog post describes the best way I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it used so far.
First of all, in Python3 you no longer need to write &amp;ldquo;super(CurrentClass, self).</description>

I think X11 is the most complex piece of software I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to work with. It has been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve had to open up xorg.conf (and before that I think it was x11.conf) to fix something that&amp;rsquo;s broken, and that&amp;rsquo;s a testament to the quality of modern versions of Ubuntu and Debian. But there was a day when I had to open that massive config file up quite often to get the video card, or mouse, or keyboard or whatever working properly.</description>

      <description>I end up using GNU &amp;ldquo;screen&amp;rdquo; a lot. It lets me SSH into my laptop, run something, then close the SSH connection with the task still running in the background. Later I can SSH in and regain control of the task. It&amp;rsquo;s helpful for Counter-Strike server admin, compiling stuff, or building a test corpus&amp;hellip;
Anyway, screen interferes with the regular terminal&amp;rsquo;s ability to scroll back and view previous program output. Today I found a description of how to fix that problem.</description>

 When the sun rises on December 22, as it surely will, do not expect apologies or even a rethink. No matter how often apocalyptic predictions fail to come true, another one soon arrives.
 They chronicle some of the apocalyptic predictions of the past 50 years or so, including acid rain, CFCs, famine, and oil shortage. I think the folks who make these predictions often want to focus humanity&amp;rsquo;s attention on some important issue.</description>

 The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary. &amp;hellip; Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that &amp;lsquo;it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do&amp;rsquo; to mention that particular fact.

I settled on &amp;ldquo;Coed Naked Motorcycle Hiking&amp;rdquo;, because I like motorcycles and I like hiking and &amp;ldquo;coed naked&amp;rdquo; seems to go pretty well in front of anything. Facebook didn&amp;rsquo;t think this religion existed, so I created a page complete with a photo from Waking Ned Devine.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Animal Farm recently, and it has impressed upon me the need to maintain arms and a force capable of using them no matter how peaceful society gets.</description>

Watching the Arab Spring on CNN International last year, and tuning into Al Jazeera English at any time, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that interviewees from the Middle East tend to use many more analogies than Western speakers. These news channels interviewed folks from all walks of life all over North Africa, and out to Afghanistan, and I noticed this pattern regularly.</description>

Of course, PHP is a pretty speedy way to develop any type of server-side web code. Josh Lockhart has put together a list of best practices for PHP development and tailored it to new PHP developers: http://www.phptherightway.com/
If developers would follow the recommendations in the databases section it would take care of so many vulnerabilities out there today.</description>

There is always a way to simplify that writing, it suggests.

Very cool. His technique relies on tricking addslashes into breaking up a two byte character with a slash, creating a valid two byte character followed by a valid one byte character. He mentions that this (specific attack) is impossible with UTF-8 because all two (or more) byte characters have continuation bytes that start with 0b10.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a creative idea I&amp;rsquo;d never considered before. I&amp;rsquo;ve written code like this, but accidentally, and then it looks wrong so I change it back. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick example:
if ( 42 == myInt ) as opposed to if ( myInt == 42 )
The former may be better to use because occasionally we all forget to put that second &amp;ldquo;=&amp;rdquo; in there, and we accidentally turn our comparison operator into an assignment operator.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a library of functions that make it very easy to work with the LCD controller. The controller has to be compatible with the HD44780 controller&amp;rsquo;s instruction set, but that&amp;rsquo;s basically an industry standard. Mouser has a selection of 20x4 character displays:</description>

I installed Cygwin in a Windows XP virtual machine, used Cygwin to install MinGW, modded my code and Makefile a bit based on the samples on that page, then ran &amp;ldquo;make windows&amp;rdquo; in that virtual machine.</description>

      <description>http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7184
This is a great Linux Journal article where they write a kernel module to hook Netfilter. It&amp;rsquo;ll probably be useful to me at some point.
What other things in the kernel can be hooked? I&amp;rsquo;m sure the list is freakin long, but this would be fun to experiment with.</description>

      <title>Geotagging Photos</title>

      <description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed by the way Picasa handles geotagging photos in Linux. It looks like the newest version doesn&amp;rsquo;t support geotagging. Not only that, but when it resizes images to upload to Picasa on the web, it kills any EXIF information that may have specified a location. What the heck Picasa? Why you gotta clobber my shit?
I can preserve the geotags by uploading directly from my G1 (slow), or by going to the Picasa website and uploading from there (can&amp;rsquo;t do a batch upload, also can&amp;rsquo;t resize automatically).</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my current chili recipe. This one is going to be awesome when it&amp;rsquo;s all done. It&amp;rsquo;s good enough right now that I have a hard time sticking to my plan to make it awesome without the spiciness, then add the spicy in later. The last few times I&amp;rsquo;ve made it I&amp;rsquo;ve added in the peppers&amp;hellip; Shame on me. It&amp;rsquo;s just too tasty to resist.

      <description>I planted 10 of my Chiltepin seeds today. At Lowes, I picked up some seedling mix, a 11.5&amp;rdquo; clay dish and a 10&amp;rdquo; plastic dish insert.
These are chili peppers that are used to dry climates, and several websites I&amp;rsquo;ve seen suggest the seeds should not be watered too much. To avoid problems with overwatering, I poked holes in the bottom of the plastic dish, filled the clay dish with sand, then put the plastic dish containing the soil on top.</description>

      <description>PSA: Don&amp;rsquo;t follow Starbucks&amp;rsquo; directions for making coffee if you like it black.
Backstory: I usually make four cups of coffee whenever I need some. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling particularly lazy (it&amp;rsquo;s a Saturday and I got excused from going into the office to get shot at) and I&amp;rsquo;d like to get some exercise, so I put a pot on. That&amp;rsquo;s four cups based on the coffee pot markings. Starbucks&amp;rsquo; directions say use 2 Tbsp (10 grams) per 6 fl oz.</description>

      <description>Why does Arnold Schwarzenegger rock so much? I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on the couch, watching True Lies and Jamie Lee Curtis is trying to screw around with another man. Why? Because she doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the true Arnold. For those who haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the movie, Schwarzenwhatever is a spy for the US. Come on, ladies love that kinda stuff, right? Anyway, what is Curtis thinking?
Then there&amp;rsquo;s his other movie. Commando. What is the most awesome part of Commando?</description>

      <description>Ok, so tonight, lying in bed, I had a few cool story ideas. If someone steals these to make a book, well, congratulations, your mind is as insane as mine. Plus, you have to send me one free review copy. That&amp;rsquo;s all I ask.
 The important part here is that an entire story line gets planned out (the story line doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter right now) and it&amp;rsquo;s a five book series.</description>
